    "\n",
    "## Your Goal\n",
    "Complete the `workspace/scene.py` file with Manim code that implements all the requested animations in a single Scene class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workspace Structure\n",
    "You have access to two folders:\n",
    "- `manim_docs/` - **READ-ONLY** Manim documentation (tutorials, guides, API reference)\n",
    "- `workspace/` - Contains `scene.py` file to complete (already has boilerplate code)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **add a single Scene class with all animations below this boilerplate**. All storyboard scenes should be implemented as sequential animations within one `construct()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRITICAL: Vertical Video Format (9:16)\n",
    "The videos are in **vertical format** (1080*1920, portrait orientation). The scene measures **8 units in width and 14 units in height** (9:16 ratio). Keep this in mind:\n",
    "- **Frame is tall and narrow** — you have much more vertical space than horizontal\n",
    "- **Stack elements vertically** rather than spreading horizontally\n",
    "- **Use more vertical space** — UP/DOWN positioning is preferred over LEFT/RIGHT\n",
    "- **Text and objects should be sized appropriately** for the narrower width, use smaller fonts and objects if needed\n",
    "- **Avoid wide layouts** — they will be cut off or cramped\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRITICAL: Research Before Coding\n",
    "You have documentation tools available and you MUST use them before writing any Manim code:\n",
    "- **ALWAYS** look up the exact API for classes, methods, and parameters you plan to use\n",
    "- **NEVER** guess or rely on memory—verify everything in the docs first\n",
    "- **RESEARCH FIRST**, then write code based on what you find\n",

    "| Tool | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| `ls` | List files in a directory with metadata (size, modified time) |\n",
    "| `read_file` | Read file contents with line numbers, supports offset/limit for large files |\n",
    "| `write_file` | Create new files |\n",
    "| `edit_file` | Perform exact string replacements in files (with global replace mode) |\n",
    "| `glob` | Find files matching patterns (e.g., `**/*.py`) |\n",
    "| `grep` | Search file contents with multiple output modes (files only, content with context, or counts) |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation Structure (in `manim_docs/`)\n",
    "- `tutorials/` - Getting started tutorials with code examples\n",
    "  - `quickstart.md` - Basic Scene patterns, Circle, Square, Transform, .animate syntax\n",
    "  - `building_blocks.md` - Mobjects, animations, scenes fundamentals\n",
    "  - `output_and_config.md` - Rendering settings and CLI options\n",
    "- `guides/` - In-depth how-to guides\n",
    "  - `using_text.md` - Text, MarkupText, Tex, MathTex rendering\n",
    "  - `configuration.md` - Config options and customization\n",
    "  - `deep_dive.md` - Manim internals and advanced concepts\n",
    "  - `add_voiceovers.md` - Adding audio narration\n",
    "- `reference_index/` - Category indices (start here to find which module you need)\n",
    "  - `animations.md` - Animation classes by category (creation, fading, transform, etc.)\n",
    "  - `mobjects.md` - Mobject classes by category (geometry, text, graph, table, etc.)\n",
    "  - `scenes.md` - Scene types (Scene, ThreeDScene, MovingCameraScene, etc.)\n",
    "  - `cameras.md`, `configuration.md`, `utilities_misc.md`\n",
    "- `reference/` - Detailed API docs for individual classes/functions (385 .md files)\n",
    "  - Named as `manim.<module>.<class>.md` (e.g., `manim.animation.creation.Create.md`)\n",
    "  - Contains parameters, methods, attributes, and usage examples\n",
    "- `reference.md` - Full hierarchical module index (lists all classes organized by module)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Workflow\n",
    "1. **Read the scene file**: Use `read_file workspace/scene.py` to see the existing boilerplate\n",
    "2. **Identify what you need**: What classes/methods will implement the storyboard animations?\n",
    "3. **Search the docs**: Use `glob` or `grep` to find relevant documentation in `manim_docs/`\n",
    "4. **Read the details**: Use `read_file` to get exact parameters, signatures, and examples\n",
    "5. **Complete the scene**: Use `edit_file` to add your Scene class code to `workspace/scene.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Manim Patterns (for reference)\n",
    "- Scenes: Subclass `Scene`, implement `construct()`, use `self.play()` for animations\n",
    "- Mobjects: Circle, Square, Text, MathTex, Arrow, VGroup, Matrix, Table, etc.\n",
    "- Animations: Create, FadeIn, FadeOut, Transform, ReplacementTransform, Write, GrowArrow\n",
    "- Positioning: `.move_to()`, `.next_to()`, `.shift()`, constants like UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n",
    "- Animate syntax: `mobject.animate.method()` to animate property changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vertical Layout Tips\n",
    "- Place titles at the top (UP * 5 or higher)\n",
    "- Stack content vertically with consistent spacing\n",
    "- Use `.scale()` to ensure objects fit within width=8 units\n",
    "- Consider using `VGroup` with `.arrange(DOWN)` for vertical stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: ALWAYS use your tools to research the documentation before writing code. Complete `workspace/scene.py` by adding your Scene class with all animations below the existing boilerplate.\"\"\"\n",

       "[HumanMessage(content=\"## Storyboard\\n\\n# Scene 1\\n## [hook] The Library of Vectors\\nOn a dark background, three distinct clusters of colorful boxes appear. The first cluster, labeled 'Queries' (Q), is a set of deep blue 1x4 horizontal rectangles. The second, labeled 'Keys' (K), is a set of golden yellow 1x4 horizontal rectangles. The third, 'Values' (V), consists of emerald green 1x4 horizontal rectangles. A single blue Query vector (q1) floats to the center. Below it, three golden Key vectors (k1, k2, k3) are lined up horizontally. The Query vector pulses, and faint gray arrows point from it to each Key, suggesting a search process. Text appears: 'What are we looking for? (Query) vs. What information is available? (Key)'.\\n\\n# Scene 2\\n## [mid] Measuring Similarity: The Dot Product\\nThe blue Query (q1) and the first golden Key (k1) align vertically. They expand slightly to show their numerical components: q1 = [0.5, 0.1, 0.8, -0.2] and k1 = [0.4, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1]. As they overlap, the corresponding elements multiply and sum: (0.5*0.4) + (0.1*0.0) + (0.8*0.9) + (-0.2*0.1) = 0.9. This result, 0.9, appears as a white scalar value above them labeled 'Score'. This repeats for k2 and k3, resulting in scores of 0.1 and -0.4. The scores are arranged in a row matrix labeled 'QK^T'. The visual emphasizes that higher overlap creates a higher score.\\n\\n# Scene 3\\n## [mid] The Scaling Factor: Safety Valve\\nThe scores [0.9, 0.1, -0.4] are suddenly replaced by much larger numbers, like [90, 10, -40], to simulate a high-dimensional space where d_k = 64. A graph of the Softmax function (a steep S-curve) appears on the right. Large values like 90 are shown far into the 'flat' region of the curve where the slope (gradient) is nearly zero. A warning symbol flashes: 'Vanishing Gradients!'. The formula component '1 / sqrt(d_k)' appears. Since d_k = 64, sqrt(d_k) = 8. The large scores are divided by 8, shrinking them back to [11.25, 1.25, -5.0]. The points on the Softmax curve slide back toward the center where the slope is steeper, indicating healthy learning.\\n\\n# Scene 4\\n## [mid] Softmax and the Weighted Sum\\nThe scaled scores enter a 'Softmax' box. Out come three probabilities (weights) that sum to 1.0: [0.85, 0.14, 0.01]. These weights are represented as semi-transparent orange overlays. These orange overlays move down to the emerald green Value vectors (v1, v2, v3). v1 becomes bright and opaque (85% weight), v2 becomes dim (14%), and v3 almost disappears (1%). The three Value vectors then physically merge/collapse into a single new vector: the 'Attention Output'. This output is a weighted average, dominated by the information in v1.\\n\\n# Scene 5\\n## [closing] The Full Engine\\nThe entire process zooms out to show the complete formula at the top: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k))V. The matrices Q, K, and V are shown as large grids. A highlight passes over the matrices to show 'FlashAttention' - instead of calculating the whole huge matrix at once, the screen divides the matrices into smaller 'tiles' or blocks that move rapidly between memory and the processor. The blocks glow as they are processed in quick succession, illustrating a 2-4x speedup. The final Attention Output vector glows brightly, symbolizing the perfectly distilled information ready for the next layer.\\n\\n\\n## Scene File\\n\\nThe following file in `workspace/` is ready for you to complete:\\n- `scene.py`\\n\\nComplete the file by adding your class and animation code below the existing boilerplate.\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='ac5358af-13be-44ad-8d0a-d4f08e84a651'),\n",

       "[HumanMessage(content='\\nUpdate the ./workspace/scene.py file to fix the issues found in the video.\\n\\n## Issues Summary\\n\\nHere\\'s a detailed QA review of the Manim animation against the provided storyboard:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**General Observation:** The overall aesthetic and clarity of the individual mathematical steps are good, but there are several discrepancies in visual elements, animation flow, and content as specified in the storyboard.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scene 1: The Library of Vectors**\\n\\n*   **Content Accuracy/Visual Fidelity (0:02):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard states, \"The first cluster, labeled \\'Queries\\' (Q), is a set of deep blue 1x4 horizontal rectangles. The second, labeled \\'Keys\\' (K), is a set of golden yellow 1x4 horizontal rectangles. The third, \\'Values\\' (V), consists of emerald green 1x4 horizontal rectangles.\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The `Keys (K)` and `Values (V)` clusters initially appear as dark brown and dark green, respectively, before transitioning to golden yellow and emerald green. The storyboard implies they should appear with their specified final colors from the start.\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The initial color of the `Keys (K)` and `Values (V)` clusters should match the \"golden yellow\" and \"emerald green\" specification upon appearance, or the storyboard should be updated to reflect the transition.\\n\\n*   **Content Accuracy/Visual Fidelity (0:04):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard states, \"Below it, three golden Key vectors (k1, k2, k3) are lined up horizontally.\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The three golden Key vectors (which are orange in the video) appear below the `Values (V)` cluster, not below the single `Query` vector (q1). Also, they seem to appear from the bottom of the screen rather than being animated as originating from the `Keys (K)` cluster at the top right, which would visually reinforce their identity. Their color is orange, not \"golden yellow\" as specified for the `Keys (K)` cluster.\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The three individual key vectors (k1, k2, k3) should appear below the single query vector (q1) to follow the visual flow of a query searching keys. Consider animating them as copies moving down from the `Keys (K)` cluster. Ensure their color matches the \"golden yellow\" of the `Keys (K)` cluster.\\n\\n*   **Animation Quality (0:06):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard states, \"The Query vector pulses...\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The Query vector (q1) does not pulse.\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Add a subtle pulsing animation to the Query vector to indicate its active state as it searches.\\n\\n*   **Content Accuracy/Layout (0:07-0:09):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard states, \"Text appears: \\'What are we looking for? (Query) vs. What information is available? (Key)\\'.\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:**\\n        1.  The text \"What are we solving for?\" appears near the `Values (V)` cluster, not near the `Queries (Q)` vector/cluster as implied for the \"Query\" part of the text.\\n        2.  The wording is \"What are we solving for?\" instead of \"What are we looking for?\".\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:**\\n        1.  Position the \"What are we looking for?\" text closer to the active Query vector (q1) or the Queries (Q) cluster.\\n        2.  Update the text to exactly match \"What are we looking for?\".\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scene 2: Measuring Similarity: The Dot Product**\\n\\n*   **No specific issues found compared to the storyboard.** The animation correctly shows the alignment, expansion, numerical components, multiplication/summation, and the scores being collected into the `QK^T` matrix.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scene 3: The Scaling Factor: Safety Valve**\\n\\n*   **No specific issues found compared to the storyboard.** The animation correctly shows the scaling of scores, the Softmax curve, the vanishing gradient issue, the application of the scaling factor `1 / sqrt(d_k)`, and the restoration of healthy gradients.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scene 4: Softmax and the Weighted Sum**\\n\\n*   **Visual Fidelity (0:39):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard states, \"These weights are represented as semi-transparent orange overlays.\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The weights are represented as numerical values (`[0.85, 0.14, 0.01]`) below the Softmax box, not as \"semi-transparent orange overlays\".\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Change the representation of the weights to semi-transparent orange overlays, as specified, instead of just numbers.\\n\\n*   **Animation Quality/Visual Fidelity (0:40-0:42):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard states, \"These orange overlays move down to the emerald green Value vectors (v1, v2, v3). v1 becomes bright and opaque (85% weight), v2 becomes dim (14%), and v3 almost disappears (1%).\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:**\\n        1.  The numerical weights appear directly *on top* of the value vectors, rather than \"moving down\" to them.\\n        2.  The value vectors themselves (v1, v2, v3) do not change their brightness, opacity, or visual emphasis to reflect their respective weights.\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:**\\n        1.  Animate the orange overlays moving from the Softmax output down to the Value vectors.\\n        2.  Implement the visual change for the Value vectors: v1 should become brighter/more opaque, v2 dimmer, and v3 almost transparent to visually represent their weighted contribution.\\n\\n*   **Layout & Composition (0:39):**\\n    *   **Issue:** Minor text overlap.\\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The \"Softmax\" label and the `[11.25 1.25 -5.00]` matrix are slightly overlapped by the newly appearing `[0.85 0.14 0.01]` matrix.\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Adjust the vertical spacing to prevent overlap between these text/matrix elements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scene 5: The Full Engine**\\n\\n*   **Animation Quality/Content Accuracy (0:49-0:53):**\\n    *   **Issue:** The storyboard describes the FlashAttention animation: \"A highlight passes over the matrices to show \\'FlashAttention\\' - instead of calculating the whole huge matrix at once, the screen divides the matrices into smaller \\'tiles\\' or blocks that move rapidly between memory and the processor. The blocks glow as they are processed in quick succession, illustrating a 2-4x speedup.\"\\n    *   **Discrepancy:**\\n        1.  After the initial yellow highlight on `Q` (0:49-0:50), the main `Q, K, V` matrices disappear abruptly at 0:53.\\n        2.  The subsequent \"tiling\" animation is abstract and doesn\\'t clearly show smaller blocks being processed *on* the original `Q, K, V` matrices or how data moves \"between memory and the processor.\" It shows smaller blocks animating within a larger container and then assembling into a larger block.\\n        3.  The individual blocks in the tiling animation do not glow as they are processed.\\n        4.  The \"2-4x speedup\" text is missing.\\n    *   **Actionable Feedback:**\\n        1.  Refine the FlashAttention visualization. Instead of making the main matrices disappear, perhaps show the tiling directly on copies of `Q, K, V` that remain visible.\\n        2.  Create a more intuitive animation where smaller \\'tile\\' blocks are extracted from the `Q`, `K`, and `V` matrices, animated as being processed (e.g., by glowing, or moving to a central \"processor\" area), and then re-integrated, perhaps forming the output in a tiled fashion.\\n        3.  Add the glowing effect to the blocks as they are processed.\\n        4.  Include the \"2-4x speedup\" text to explicitly highlight the benefit of FlashAttention.\\n\\n---\\nThis concludes the detailed QA review.\\n\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3f556730-00f3-4144-a562-d1a4e84ca1e5'),\n",

The default is `1.2` (20% larger). Increase this value for a stronger pulse.\\n*   **Color:** Controlled by the `color` parameter. The default is `YELLOW`.\\n\\n### 2. Emerald Green Color\\nManim does not have a predefined `EMERALD` constant. You should use the standard hex code for Emerald Green, which is **`#50C878`**.\\n\\n### Example Code\\nHere is how you can implement this in your scene:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom manim import *\\n\\nclass IndicateExample(Scene):\\n    def construct(self):\\n        # Define Emerald Green manually\\n        EMERALD = \"#50C878\"\\n\\n        # Create a sample object\\n        circle = Circle(radius=1, color=WHITE)\\n        self.add(circle)\\n\\n        # Apply Indicate with pulsing (scale_factor) and emerald color\\n        self.play(\\n            Indicate(\\n                circle,\\n                scale_factor=1.5,  # 1.5 makes it pulse 50% larger (default is 1.2)\\n                color=EMERALD\\n            )\\n        )\\n```\\n\\n**Summary of Parameters:**\\n*   **`scale_factor`**: Set to `1.5` (or your preferred size) to create the pulsing effect.\\n*   **`color`**: Set to `\\'#50C878\\'` for emerald green.', name='task', id='933564dc-5b4a-40fb-94eb-b1e18effc3c4', tool_call_id='d6ac828b-854b-4682-91d1-834d53525fca'),\n",
